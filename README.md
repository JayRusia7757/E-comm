# ðŸ“Š Gantt Chart Generator ðŸ”„

A web-based tool to generate Gantt charts and calculate TAT (Turnaround Time) and WT (Waiting Time) based on various scheduling algorithms. It supports the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm by default, and you can extend it to include other popular scheduling algorithms like Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), and more.

## Features

âœ¨ Input validation: Ensures accurate scheduling calculations by validating input values.

ðŸš¦ Error handling: Provides informative error messages for better troubleshooting.

ðŸ“Š Dynamic visualization: Displays Gantt chart bars dynamically, making it easier to understand the scheduling process.

ðŸ’¡ Detailed process information: Shows Arrival Time, Burst Time, Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time for each process.

ðŸŒŸ Simple and intuitive web interface: Allows users to generate Gantt charts and analyze scheduling algorithms with ease.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the number of processes, arrival times, and burst times.
4. Select the scheduling algorithm (FCFS by default).
5. Click the "Generate Gantt Chart" button to view the results.
6. The Gantt chart, along with the process information, will be displayed on the page.

Feel free to customize and enhance the tool based on your specific requirements. You can add support for additional scheduling algorithms, implement more robust input validation, and improve the user interface.
